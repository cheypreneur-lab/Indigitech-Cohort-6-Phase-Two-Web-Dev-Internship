        I enjoy listening to Tia Wood because she is a Rez girl who followed her
        passion and heart to the city to make her musical dreams come true. Her
        voice is souful grassroots blended with urban beats
      </p>
      <p>A few of my favorite songs are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dirt Road</li>
        <li>Sky High</li>
        <li>Never Come Down</li>
      </ul>

        Where do I start?/ How do I say it?/ My voice is so tired and I cannot
        fake it/ Our mothers, daughters, sisters/ Go missing every day/ Hard to
        feel hopeful/ When hope feels far away.
